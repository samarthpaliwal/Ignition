# 🔥 Ignition

Ever wonder why your AI doesn’t give you the answer you need?  
**Ignition** is a first-of-its-kind visual debugging tool for AI and LLMs.  
It helps ML professionals trace and visualize every step of an AI’s reasoning, turning black-box models into transparent, editable flows for debugging, analysis, and improvement.

- 📊 **Visual Trace Graph** — see how your AI reaches an answer  
- 🛠️ **Debugging Tools** — edit steps, re-run from any point, and compare outputs  
- 🔍 **Why Heatmap** — understand which tokens influenced the result  
- ⚡ **Local or Remote Models** — run with `llama.cpp`, Hugging Face `.gguf` models, or Ollama  
- 🖥️ **Modern UI** — built with PySide6 (Qt)
